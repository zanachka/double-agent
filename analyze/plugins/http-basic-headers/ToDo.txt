- header order and default values are aggregated across all pages, which may open up issues. For example, default values
 likely changes based on the how the pages were accessed. At some point we need to check based on more intelligent patterns.

- We are currently penalizing based on the upper/lower case of headers that have been seen for a given browser. However, some headers never show on certain browsers -- we should add penalties when these headers appear. For example, "sec-fetch-site" is not supported by all Firefox browsers and < 76 Chrome browsers.
